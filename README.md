# classic-arcade-game

In this project I will be building my own very simple arcade game.

## Rule of the game

In this game you will have a **Player** and **Enemies(the Bugs)**. The goal of the player is to reach the water,
without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move
in varying speeds on the block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game
is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
It will console.log("You won the game!!!"). After the you won, the game will be reset by moving the player
back to the initial location.

## Controller

1. **Left key** : move the player to the left.
2. **Right key** : move the player to the right.
3. **Up key** : move the player up.
4. **Down key** : move the player down.
